  abstract = {Among the factors that affect the conservation efficiency of protected areas, lack of connectivity is considered as one of the main problems. In this study, we assessed the influence of connectivity of European beech forest reserves on wood-inhabiting fungal communities, compared to the influence of local factors. To address this topic, we used a data matrix consisting of 344 fungal species on 1571 resource units (i.e. fallen beech logs, including their standing snags) sampled in 42 European beech forest reserves. Our results show that connectivity has significant effects on wood-inhabiting fungal communities in European beech forest reserves, and that the effectiveness of reserves for maintaining the wood-inhabiting fungal diversity is compromised by habitat fragmentation. Connectivity at small scales (measured as the area of the reserve) had a strong influence on the occurrence of indicator species and was also critical for the number of species at a resource. Connectivity at larger scales (connectivity to surrounding beech forests) seemed to be particularly critical for the community composition both at resource and reserve levels. In line with previous research, we found other covariates such as size of the resource units and annual temperature range to positively influence wood-inhabiting fungal species richness. The effects of habitat fragmentation were especially strong in western and northern European regions where the smallest and more isolated reserves were located. We propose that an effective conservation strategy for wood-inhabiting fungi should focus on increasing the areas of the present reserves as well as conserving new reserves in the proximity of the existing ones.},

  abstract = {Many forest management activities, including the development of forest inventories, require spatially detailed forest canopy cover and height data. Among the various remote sensing technologies, LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) offers the most accurate and consistent means for obtaining reliable canopy structure measurements. A potential solution to reduce the cost of LiDAR data, is to integrate transects (samples) of LiDAR data with frequently acquired and spatially comprehensive optical remotely sensed data. Although multiple regression is commonly used for such modeling, often it does not fully capture the complex relationships between forest structure variables. This study investigates the potential of Random Forest (RF), a machine learning technique, to estimate LiDAR measured canopy structure using a time series of Landsat imagery. The study is implemented over a 2600ha area of industrially managed coastal temperate forests on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. We implemented a trajectory-based approach to time series analysis that generates time since disturbance (TSD) and disturbance intensity information for each pixel and we used this information to stratify the forest land base into two strata: mature forests and young forests. Canopy cover and height for three forest classes (i.e. mature, young and mature and young (combined)) were modeled separately using multiple regression and Random Forest (RF) techniques. For all forest classes, the RF models provided improved estimates relative to the multiple regression models. The lowest validation error was obtained for the mature forest strata in a RF model (R2=0.88, RMSE=2.39m and bias=-0.16 for canopy height; R2=0.72, RMSE=0.068\% and bias=-0.0049 for canopy cover). This study demonstrates the value of using disturbance and successional history to inform estimates of canopy structure and obtain improved estimates of forest canopy cover and height using the RF algorithm.},

  abstract = {The factors controlling the extent of fire in Africa south of the equator were investigated using moderate resolution (500 m) satellite-derived burned area maps and spatial data on the environmental factors thought to affect burnt area. A random forest regression tree procedure was used to determine the relative importance of each factor in explaining the burned area fraction and to address hypotheses concerned with human and climatic influences on the drivers of burnt area. The model explained 68\% of the variance in burnt area. Tree cover, rainfall in the previous 2 years, and rainfall seasonality were the most important predictors. Human activities - represented by grazing, roads per unit area, population density, and cultivation fraction - were also shown to affect burnt area, but only in parts of the continent with specific climatic conditions, and often in ways counter to the prevailing wisdom that more human activity leads to more fire. The analysis found no indication that ignitions were limiting total burnt area on the continent, and most of the spatial variation was due to variation in fuel load and moisture. Split conditions from the regression tree identified (i) low rainfall regions, where fire is rare; (ii) regions where fire is under human control; and (iii) higher rainfall regions where burnt area is determined by rainfall seasonality. This study provides insights into the physical, climatic, and human drivers of fire and their relative importance across southern Africa, and represents the beginnings of a predictive framework for burnt area.},

This classifier has become popular within the remote sensing community due to the accuracy of its classifications. The overall objective of this work was to review the utilization of RF classifier in remote sensing. This review has revealed that RF classifier can successfully handle high data dimensionality and multicolinearity, being both fast and insensitive to overfitting. It is, however, sensitive to the sampling design. The variable importance (VI) measurement provided by the RF classifier has been extensively exploited in different scenarios, for example to reduce the number of dimensions of hyperspectral data, to identify the most relevant multisource remote sensing and geographic data, and to select the most suitable season to classify particular target classes. Further investigations are required into less commonly exploited uses of this classifier, such as for sample proximity analysis to detect and remove outliers in the training samples.

The results from a sample of 48,600 simulations each of length 100 years using an hourly time step are conditioned on low return period regionalized flood frequency, snow water equivalent, and flow duration curve information. Performance measures for each predicted variable are combined using fuzzy inference and simulations considered as nonbehavioral are rejected. 10,000-year simulations are made with the remaining 2281 behavioral simulations to produce prediction limits for flood magnitudes and other response variables at different return periods. The results are checked against a historical series of annual maximum discharges available at the site for a period before it was destroyed by the construction of a dam. The results compare well and appear to give more realistic prediction bounds than statistical extrapolations based on the Wakeby distribution, particularly at longer return periods.},

  abstract = {The hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA; Adelges tsugae) is an invasive insect infestation that is spreading into the forests of the northeastern United States, driven by the warmer winter temperatures associated with climate change. The initial stages of this disturbance are difficult to detect with passive optical remote sensing, since the insect often causes its host species, eastern hemlock trees (Tsuga canadensis), to defoliate in the midstory and understory before showing impacts in the overstory. New active remote sensing technologies\&mdash;such as the recently launched NASA Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) spaceborne lidar\&mdash;can address this limitation by penetrating canopy gaps and recording lower canopy structural changes. This study explores new opportunities for monitoring the HWA infestation with airborne lidar scanning (ALS) and GEDI spaceborne lidar data. GEDI waveforms were simulated using airborne lidar datasets from an HWA-infested forest plot at the Harvard Forest ForestGEO site in central Massachusetts. Two airborne lidar instruments, the NASA G-LiHT and the NEON AOP, overflew the site in 2012 and 2016. GEDI waveforms were simulated from each airborne lidar dataset, and the change in waveform metrics from 2012 to 2016 was compared to field-derived hemlock mortality at the ForestGEO site. Hemlock plots were shown to be undergoing dynamic changes as a result of the HWA infestation, losing substantial plant area in the middle canopy, while still growing in the upper canopy. Changes in midstory plant area (PAI 11\&ndash;12 m above ground) and overall canopy permeability (indicated by RH10) accounted for 60\% of the variation in hemlock mortality in a logistic regression model. The robustness of these structure-condition relationships held even when simulated waveforms were treated as real GEDI data with added noise and sparse spatial coverage. These results show promise for future disturbance monitoring studies with ALS and GEDI lidar data.},

  abstract = {Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148\textendash 156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

In the weather model Monte Carlo techniques were employed to generate daily values of precipitation, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, minimum relative humidity and total solar radiation. Each weather variable is described by a known theoretical probability distribution but the values of the parameters describing each distribution are dependent on the occurrence of rainfall. Precipitation occurrence is described by a first-order Markov chain. The amount of rain, given that rain has occurred, is described by a gamma probability distribution. Maximum and minimum temperature are simulated with a trivariate normal probability distribution involving maximum temperature on the previous day, maximum temperature on the current day and minimum temperature on the current day. Parameter values for this distribution are dependent on the occurrence of rain on the previous day. Both minimum relative humidity and total solar radiation are assumed to be normally distributed. The values of the parameters describing the distribution of minimum relative humidity is dependent on rainfall occurrence on the previous day and current day. Parameter values for total solar radiation are dependent on the occurrence of rain on the current day. The assumptions made during model construction were found to be appropriate for actual weather data from Geneva, New York. The performance of the weather model was evaluated by comparing the cumulative frequency distributions of simulated weather data with the distributions of actual weather data from Geneva, New York and Fort Collins, Colorado. For each location, simulated weather data were similar to actual weather data in terms of mean response, variability and autocorrelation. The possible applications of this model when used with models of other components of the agro-ecosystem are discussed.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

However, recent research indicates that isolation from direct deforestation or degradation may not be sufficient to maintain the ecological integrity of Amazon forests over the next several decades. Large-scale changes in fire and drought regimes occurring as a result of deforestation and greenhouse gas increases may result in forest degradation, regardless of protected status. How severe or widespread these feedbacks will be is uncertain, but the arc of deforestation in south-southeastern Amazonia appears to be particularly vulnerable owing to high current deforestation rates and ecological sensitivity to climate change. Maintaining forest ecosystem integrity may require significant strengthening of forest conservation on private property, which can in part be accomplished by leveraging existing policy mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Ecological regionalisations delineate areas of similar environmental conditions, ecological processes, and biotic communities, and provide a basis for systematic conservation planning and management. Most regionalisations are made based on subjective criteria, and can not be readily revised, leading to outstanding questions with respect to how to optimally develop and define them. Advances in remote sensing technology, and big data analysis approaches, provide new opportunities for regionalisations, especially in terms of productivity patterns through both photosynthesis and structural surrogates. Here we show that global terrestrial productivity dynamics can be captured by Dynamics Habitat Indices (DHIs) and we conduct a regionalisation based on the DHIs using a two-stage multivariate clustering approach. Encouragingly, the derived clusters are more homogeneous in terms of species richness of three key taxa, and of canopy height, than a conventional regionalisation. We conclude with discussing the benefits of these remotely derived clusters for biodiversity assessments and conservation. The clusters based on the DHIs explained more variance, and greater within-region homogeneity, compared to conventional regionalisations for species richness of both amphibians and mammals, and were comparable in the case of birds. Structure as defined by global tree height was also better defined by productivity driven clusters than conventional regionalisations. These results suggest that ecological regionalisations based on remotely sensed metrics have clear advantages over conventional regionalisations for certain applications, and they are also more easily updated.},

  abstract = {Protected areas (PAs) often depend on landscapes surrounding them to maintain flows of organisms, water, nutrients, and energy. Park managers have little authority over the surrounding landscape although land use change and infrastructure development can have major impacts on the integrity of a PA. The need for scientifically-based regional-scale land use planning around protected areas is acute in human-dominated landscapes to balance conservation goals with livelihood needs for fuelwood, fodder, and other ecosystem services. As a first step, we propose the designation of a ``zone of interaction'' (ZOI) around PAs that encompasses hydrologic, ecological, and socioeconomic interactions between a PA and the surrounding landscape. We illustrate the concept by delineating the ZOI in three Indian PAs \textendash{} Kanha, Ranthambore, and Nagarahole \textendash{} using remote sensing, population census, and field data. The ZOI in Ranthambore is three times the size of the park and is largely defined by the socioeconomic interactions with surrounding villages. Ranthambore is located in headwaters and wildlife corridors are largely severed. In Nagarahole, the ZOI is more than seven times larger than the park and includes upstream watershed and elephant corridors. Kanha's ZOI is approximately four times larger than the park and is mostly defined by contiguous surrounding forest. The three examples highlight the differing extents of ZOIs when applying equivalent criteria, even though all are located in densely-populated landscapes. Quantitative understanding of which activities (e.g. collection of forest products, grazing, road construction, tourism development) and which locations within the ZOI are most crucial to conservation goals will enable improved land use planning around PAs in human-dominated landscapes.},

Such observations are critical for accurately assessing the existing biomass of forests, and how changes in this biomass caused by human activities or variations in climate may impact atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Additionally, the three-dimensional structure of forests is a key component of habitat quality and biodiversity at local to regional scales. The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) was launched to the International Space Station in late 2018 to provide high-quality measurements of forest vertical structure in temperate and tropical forests between 51.6\textdegree{} N \& S latitude. The GEDI instrument is a geodetic-class laser altimeter/waveform lidar comprised of 3 lasers that produce 8 transects of structural information. Over its two-year nominal lifetime GEDI is anticipated to provide over 10 billion waveforms at a footprint resolution of 25~\mbox m. These data will be used to derive a variety of footprint and gridded products, including canopy height, canopy foliar profiles, Leaf Area Index (LAI), sub-canopy topography and biomass. Additionally, data from GEDI are used to demonstrate the efficacy of its measurements for prognostic ecosystem modeling, habit and biodiversity studies, and for fusion using radar and other remote sensing instruments. GEDI science and technology are unique: no other space-based mission has been created that is specifically optimized for retrieving vegetation vertical structure. As such, GEDI promises to advance our understanding of the importance of canopy vertical variations within an ecological paradigm based on structure, composition and function.},

  abstract = {Estimates of the magnitude and distribution of aboveground carbon in Earth's forests remain uncertain, yet knowledge of forest carbon content at a global scale is critical for forest management in support of climate mitigation. In light of this knowledge gap, several upcoming spaceborne missions aim to map forest aboveground biomass, and many new biomass products are expected from these datasets. As these new missions host different technologies, each with relative strengths and weaknesses for biomass retrieval, as well as different spatial resolutions, consistently comparing or combining biomass estimates from these new datasets will be challenging. This paper presents a demonstration of an inter-comparison of biomass estimates from simulations of three NASA missions (GEDI, ICESat-2 and NISAR) over Sonoma county in California, USA. We use a high resolution, locally calibrated airborne lidar map as our reference dataset, and emphasize the importance of considering uncertainties in both reference maps and spaceborne estimates when conducting biomass product validation. GEDI and ICESat-2 were simulated from airborne lidar point clouds, while UAVSAR's L-band backscatter was used as a proxy for NISAR. To estimate biomass for the lidar missions we used GEDI's footprint-level biomass algorithms, and also adapted these for application to ICESat-2. For UAVSAR, we developed a locally trained biomass model, calibrated against the ALS reference map. Each mission simulation was evaluated in comparison to the local reference map at its native product resolution (25~m, 100~m transect, and 1~ha) yielding RMSEs of 57\%, 75\%, and 89\% for GEDI, NISAR, and ICESat-2 respectively. RMSE values increased for GEDI's power beam during simulated daytime conditions (64\%), coverage beam during nighttime conditions (72\%), and coverage beam daytime conditions (87\%). We also test the application of GEDI's biomass modeling framework for estimation of biomass from ICESat-2, and find that ICESat-2 yields reasonable biomass estimates, particularly in relatively short, open canopies. Results suggest that while all three missions will produce datasets useful for biomass mapping, tall, dense canopies such as those found in Sonoma County present the greatest challenges for all three missions, while steep slopes also prove challenging for single-date SAR-based biomass retrievals. Our methods provide guidance for the inter-comparison and validation of spaceborne biomass estimates through the use of airborne lidar reference maps, and could be repeated with on-orbit estimates in any area with high quality field plot and ALS data. These methods allow for regional interpretations and filtering of multi-mission biomass estimates toward improved wall-to-wall biomass maps through data fusion.},

  abstract = {Quantifying aboveground biomass in forest ecosystems is required for carbon stock estimation, aspects of forest management, and further developing a capacity for monitoring carbon stocks over time. Airborne Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) systems, of all remote sensing technologies, have been demonstrated to yield the most accurate estimates of aboveground biomass for forested areas over a wide range of biomass values. However, these systems are limited by considerations including large data volumes and high costs. Within the constraints imposed by the nature of the satellite mission, the GeoScience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) aboard ICESat has provided data conferring information regarding forest vertical structure for large areas at a low end user cost. GLAS data have been demonstrated to accurately estimate forest height and aboveground biomass especially well in topographically smooth areas with homogeneous forested conditions. However in areas with dense forests, high relief, or heterogeneous vegetation cover, GLAS waveforms are more complex and difficult to consistently characterize. We use airborne discrete return LiDAR data to simulate GLAS waveforms and to subsequently deconstruct coregistered GLAS waveforms into vegetation and ground returns. A series of waveform metrics was calculated and compared to topography and vegetation information gleaned from the airborne data. A model to estimate maximum relief directly from waveform metrics was developed with an R2 of 0.76 (n=110), and used for the classification of the maximum relief of the areas sensed by GLAS. Discriminant analysis was also conducted as an alternative classification technique. A model was also developed estimating forest canopy height from waveform metrics for all of the data (R2=0.81, n=110) and for the three separate relief classes; maximum relief 0\textendash 7m (R2=0.83, n=44), maximum relief 7\textendash 15m (R2=0.88, n=41) and maximum relief {$>$}15m (R2=0.75, n=25). The moderate relief class model yielded better predictions of forest height than the low relief class model which is attributed to the increasing variability of waveform metrics with terrain relief. The moderate relief class model also yielded better predictions than the high relief class model because of the mixing of vegetation and terrain signals in waveforms from high relief footprints. This research demonstrates that terrain can be accurately modeled directly from GLAS waveforms enabling the inclusion of terrain relief, on a waveform specific basis, as supplemental model input to improve estimates of canopy height.},

  abstract = {An object-oriented verification procedure is presented for gridded quantitative precipitation forecasts (QPFs). It is carried out within the framework of "contiguous rain areas" (CRAs), whereby a weather system is defined as a region bounded by a user-specified isopleth of precipitation in the union of the: forecast and observed rain fields. The horizontal displacement of the forecast is determined by translating the forecast rain field until the total squared difference between the observed and forecast fields is minimized. This allows a decomposition of total error into components due to: (a) location; (b) rain volume and (c) pattern. Results are first presented for a Monte Carlo simulation of 40,000 synthetic CRAs in order to determine the accuracy of the verification procedure when the rain systems are only partially observed due to the presence of domain boundaries. Verification is then carried out for operational 24-h forecasts from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology LAPS numerical weather prediction model over a four-year period. Forty-five percent of all rain events were well forecast by the model, with small location and intensity errors. Location error was generally the dominant source of QPF error, with the directions of most frequent displacement varying by region. Forty-five percent of extreme rainfall events ({$>$}100 mm d (1)) were well forecast, but in this case the model's underestimation of rain intensity was the most frequent sourer of error.

  abstract = {Spatial estimates of tropical soil organic carbon (SOC) concentrations and stocks are crucial to understanding the role of tropical SOC in the global carbon cycle. They also allow for spatial variation of SOC in environmental process models. SOC is spatially highly variable. In traditional approaches, SOC concentrations and stocks have been derived from estimates for single or very few profiles and spatially linked to existing units of soil or vegetation maps. However, many existing soil profile data are incomplete and untested as to whether they are representative or unbiased. Also single means for soil or vegetation map units cannot characterize SOC spatial variability within these units. We here use the digital soil mapping approach to predict the spatial distribution of SOC. This relies on a soil inference model based on spatially referenced environmental layers of topographic attributes, soil units, parent material, and forest history. We sampled soils at 165 sites, stratified according to topography and lithology, on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama, at depths of 0\textendash 10~cm, 10\textendash 20~cm, 20\textendash 30~cm, and 30\textendash 50~cm, and analyzed them for SOC by dry combustion. We applied Random Forest (RF) analysis as a modeling tool to the SOC data for each depth interval in order to compare vertical and lateral distribution patterns. RF has several advantages compared to other modeling approaches, for instance, the fact that it is neither sensitive to overfitting nor to noise features. The RF-based digital SOC mapping approach provided SOC estimates of high spatial resolution and estimates of error and predictor importance. The environmental variables that explained most of the variation in the topsoil (0\textendash 10~cm) were topographic attributes. In the subsoil (10\textendash 50~cm), SOC distribution was best explained by soil texture classes as derived from soil mapping units. The estimates for SOC stocks in the upper 30~cm ranged between 38 and 116~Mg ha-1, with lowest stocks on midslope and highest on toeslope positions. This digital soil mapping approach can be applied to similar landscapes to refine the spatial resolution of SOC estimates.},

GEDI uses a waveform simulator for calibration of algorithms and assessing mission accuracy. This paper implements a waveform simulator, using the method proposed in Blair and Hofton (1999; https://doi.org/10.1029/1999GL010484), and builds upon that work by adding instrument noise and by validating simulated waveforms across a range of forest types, airborne laser scanning (ALS) instruments, and survey configurations. The simulator was validated by comparing waveform metrics derived from simulated waveforms against those derived from observed large-footprint, full-waveform lidar data from NASA's airborne Land, Vegetation, and Ice Sensor (LVIS). The simulator was found to produce waveform metrics with a mean bias of less than 0.22 m and a root-mean-square error of less than 5.7 m, as long as the ALS data had sufficient pulse density. The minimum pulse density required depended upon the instrument. Measurement errors due to instrument noise predicted by the simulator were within 1.5 m of those from observed waveforms and 70\textendash 85\% of variance in measurement error was explained. Changing the ALS survey configuration had no significant impact on simulated metrics, suggesting that the ALS pulse density is a sufficient metric of simulator accuracy across the range of conditions and instruments tested. These results give confidence in the use of the simulator for the pre-launch calibration and performance assessment of the GEDI mission.},

Objectives included comparing the performance of Landsat 7- and 8-derived inputs separately and combined in mapping tree height at a regional scale, assessing the relative value of good observation counts and different Landsat spectral inputs for tree height estimation across a range of environments, and describing tree height distributions and discontinuities in Sub-Saharan Africa. A total of 5371 images were processed and per pixel quality assessed to create a set of multi-temporal metrics for the 2013 and 2014 calendar years for Landsat 7 only, Landsat 8 only and both Landsat 7 and 8 combined. Differences in performance were slight between different sensor inputs. However, performance generally improved with increasing numbers of good observations. Metrics derived from red reflectance data contributed most in estimating tree height. The regression tree algorithm accurately reproduced the LiDAR-derived height training data with an overall mean absolute error (MAE) for tree height estimation of 2.45m using integrated Landsat 7 and 8 data. Significant underestimations were quantified for tall tree cover (MAE of 4.65m for {$>$}20m heights) and overestimations for low/no tree cover (MAE 1.61 for {$<$}5m heights). Resulting tree distributions were found to be discontinuous with a primary dry seasonal woodlands cluster of 5\textendash 10m in height, a second cluster of primarily dry evergreen forest tree cover from 11\textendash 17m, and a third cluster of humid evergreen forest tree cover {$\geq$}18m. The integration of Landsat 7 and 8 and forthcoming Sentinel 2 time-series optical data to extend the value of LiDAR forest structure measurements is recommended.},

However, little attention has been given to comparisons of the accuracy of the different estimation methods of canopy height or to the evaluation of the error factors in canopy height estimation. In this study, we tested three methods of estimating canopy height using the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) onboard NASA's Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat), and evaluated several factors that affected accuracy. Our study areas were Tomakomai and Kushiro, two forested areas on Hokkaido in Japan. The accuracy of the canopy height estimates was verified by ground-based measurements. We also conducted a multivariate analysis using quantification theory type I (multiple-regression analysis of qualitative data) and identified the observation conditions that had a large influence on estimation accuracy. The method using the digital elevation model was the most accurate, with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 3.2m. However, GLAS data with a low signal-to-noise ratio ({$\leqslant$}10.0) and that taken from September to October 2009 had to be excluded from the analysis because the estimation accuracy of canopy height was remarkably low. After these data were excluded, the multivariate analysis showed that surface slope had the greatest effect on estimation accuracy, and the accuracy dropped the most in steeply sloped areas. We developed a second model with two equations to estimate canopy height depending on the surface slope, which improved estimation accuracy (RMSE=2.8m). These results should prove useful and provide practical suggestions for estimating forest canopy height using spaceborne LiDAR.},

  abstract = {The use of time series satellite data allows for the temporally dense, systematic, transparent, and synoptic capture of land dynamics over time. Subsequent to the opening of the Landsat archive, several time series approaches for characterizing landscape change have been developed, often representing a particular analytical time window. The information richness and widespread utility of these time series data have created a need to maintain the currency of time series information via the addition of new data, as it becomes available. When an existing time series is temporally extended, it is critical that previously generated change information remains consistent, thereby not altering reported change statistics or science outcomes based on that change information. In this research, we investigate the impacts and implications of adding additional years to an existing 29-year annual Landsat time series for forest change. To do so, we undertook a spatially explicit comparison of the 29 overlapping years of a time series representing 1984\textendash 2012, with a time series representing 1984\textendash 2016. Surface reflectance values, and presence, year, and type of change were compared. We found that the addition of years to extend the time series had minimal effect on the annual surface reflectance composites, with slight band-specific differences (r {$\geq$} 0.1) in the final years of the original time series being updated. The area of stand replacing disturbances and determination of change year are virtually unchanged for the overlapping period between the two time-series products. Over the overlapping temporal period (1984\textendash 2012), the total area of change differs by 0.53\%, equating to an annual difference in change area of 0.019\%. Overall, the spatial and temporal agreement of the changes detected by both time series was 96\%. Further, our findings suggest that the entire pre-existing historic time series does not need to be re-processed during the update process. Critically, given the time series change detection and update approach followed here, science outcomes or reports representing one temporal epoch can be considered stable and will not be altered when a time series is updated with newly available data.},

Lidar remote sensing has been proven to directly derive tree height as a key variable of forest structure. The GLAS signal is, however, very sensitive to surface topography because of the large footprint size. This study therefore focuses on forests in a mountainous area to assess the potential of GLAS data to derive terrain elevation and tree height. The work enhances the empirical knowledge about the interaction between GLAS waveform and landscape structure regarding a special temperate forest site with a complex terrain. An algorithm to retrieve tree height directly from GLA01 waveform data is proposed and compared to an approach using GLA14 Gaussian parameters. The results revealed that GLAS height estimates were accurate for areas with a slope up to 10\textdegree{} whereas waveforms of areas above 15\textdegree{} were problematic. Slopes between 10\textendash 15\textdegree{} have been found to be a critical crossover. Further, different waveform shape types and landscape structure classes were developed as a new possibility to explore the waveform in its whole structure. Based on the detailed analysis of some waveform examples, it could be demonstrated that the waveform shape can be regarded as a product of the complex interaction between surface and canopy structure. Consequently, there is a great variety of waveform shapes which in turn considerably hampers GLAS tree height extraction in areas with steep slopes and complex forest conditions.},

  abstract = {Productivity of lentic ecosystems is well studied, and it is widely accepted that as nutrient inputs increase, productivity increases and lakes transition from lower trophic state (e.g., oligotrophic) to higher trophic states (e.g., eutrophic). These broad trophic state classifications are good predictors of ecosystem condition, services (e.g., recreation and esthetics), and disservices (e.g., harmful algal blooms). While the relationship between nutrients and trophic state provides reliable predictions, it requires in situ water quality data to parameterize the model. This limits the application of these models to lakes with existing and, more importantly, available water quality data. To address this, we take advantage of the availability of a large national lakes water quality database (i.e., the National Lakes Assessment), land-use/land-cover data, lake morphometry data, and other universally available data, and we apply data-mining approaches to predict trophic state. Using these data and random forests, we first model chlorophyll a and then classify the resultant predictions into trophic states. The full model estimates chlorophyll a with both in situ and universally available data. The mean-squared error and adjusted R2 of this model was 0.09 and 0.8, respectively. The second model uses universally available GIS data only. The mean-squared error was 0.22, and the adjusted R2 was 0.48. The Kappa coefficients of the trophic state classifications derived from the chlorophyll a predictions were 0.57 for the full model and 0.29 for the ``GIS-only'' model. Random forests extend the usefulness of the class predictions by providing prediction probabilities for each lake. This allows us to make trophic state predictions and also indicate the level of uncertainty around those predictions. For the full model, these predicted class probabilities ranged from 0.42 to 1. For the GIS-only model, they ranged from 0.33 to 0.96. It is our conclusion that in situ data are required for better predictions, yet GIS and universally available data provide trophic state predictions, with estimated uncertainty, that still have the potential for a broad array of applications.

Accurate estimations of global forest aboveground biomass (AGB) can improve the understanding of global carbon dynamics and help to quantify anthropogenic carbon emissions. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) techniques have been proven that can accurately capture both horizontal and vertical forest structures and increase the accuracy of forest AGB estimation. In this study, we mapped the global forest AGB density at a 1-km resolution through the integration of ground inventory data, optical imagery, Geoscience Laser Altimeter System/Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite data, climate surfaces, and topographic data. Over 4000 ground inventory records were collected from published literatures to train the forest AGB estimation model and validate the resulting global forest AGB product. Our wall-to-wall global forest AGB map showed that the global forest AGB density was 210.09 Mg/ha on average, with a standard deviation of 109.31 Mg/ha. At the continental level, Africa (333.34 {$\pm$} 63.80 Mg/ha) and South America (301.68 {$\pm$} 67.43 Mg/ha) had higher AGB density. The AGB density in Asia, North America and Europe were 172.28 {$\pm$} 94.75, 166.48 {$\pm$} 84.97, and 132.97 {$\pm$} 50.70 Mg/ha, respectively. The wall-to-wall forest AGB map was evaluated at plot level using independent plot measurements. The adjusted coefficient of determination (R2) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) between our predicted results and the validation plots were 0.56 and 87.53 Mg/ha, respectively. At the ecological zone level, the R2 and RMSE between our map and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change suggested values were 0.56 and 101.21 Mg/ha, respectively. Moreover, a comprehensive comparison was also conducted between our forest AGB map and other published regional AGB products. Overall, our forest AGB map showed good agreements with these regional AGB products, but some of the regional AGB products tended to underestimate forest AGB density.},

For biomes, protection ranges from 4\% to 25\%, with six of 14 biomes still below the 10\% level. Geographic patterns of protection have a distinct bias, with higher rates of protection in New World realms than Old World realms. Of the world's terrestrial ecoregions, half do not meet the 2010 Target and 76\% have less than 10\% of their area strictly protected. Approximately 13\% of ecoregions have no strict protected areas. Recent years have seen an expansion of the protected area network, with an average of 0.13\% of the global land area added per year. Most of the expansion since 2003 though has been in Brazil, particularly the Amazon. Without major investments in conservation, spread across the world's ecosystems, the world will likely miss the 2010 target.},

Here, we present a novel supervised machine learning approach to interpret GEDI waveforms and regress canopy top height globally. We propose a Bayesian convolutional neural network (CNN) to avoid the explicit modelling of unknown effects, such as atmospheric noise. The model learns to extract robust features that generalize to unseen geographical regions and, in addition, yields reliable estimates of predictive uncertainty. Ultimately, the global canopy top height estimates produced by our model have an expected RMSE of 2.7 m with low bias.},

For example, in a rapidly changing climate is it practical to continue to identify and protect `representative' samples of the natural heritage estate? This paper examines a number of climate-related issues that now confront agencies and organizations responsible for the protection of natural heritage areas, including the roles of protected areas, representation targets, ecological integrity, protected area design, management techniques, research and monitoring needs, and agency capacity to respond. Potential avenues for adaptation are proposed in light of these issues. The development and implementation of a cross-jurisdictional landscape-scale strategic conservation framework focused on protecting, connecting, and restoring ecosystems will be fundamental to enhancing ecological resilience to climate change. We conclude that even though climate change presents unprecedented and significant challenges, the protected area contribution to ecosystem function and human health and well-being will remain an essential and worthwhile investment in the 21st century.},

Geolocation validation confirms the altimeter\&rsquo;s ability to accurately position the measurement on the surface of the Earth and provides insight into the fidelity of the geolocation determination process. Surfaces well characterized by independent methods are well suited to provide a measure of the ICESat-2 geolocation accuracy through statistical comparison. This study compares airborne lidar data with the ICESat-2 along-track geolocated photon data product to determine the horizontal geolocation accuracy by minimizing the vertical residuals between datasets. At the same location arrays of corner cube retro-reflectors (CCRs) provide unique signal signatures back to the satellite from their known positions to give a deterministic solution of the laser footprint diameter and the geolocation accuracy for those cases where two or more CCRs were illuminated within one ICESat-2 transect. This passive method for diameter recovery and geolocation accuracy assessment is implemented at two locations: White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) in New Mexico and along the 88\&deg;S latitude line in Antarctica. This early on-orbit study provides results as a proof of concept for this passive validation technique. For the cases studied the diameter value ranged from 10.6 to 12 m. The variability is attributed to the statistical nature of photon-counting lidar technology and potentially, variations in the atmospheric conditions that impact signal transmission. The geolocation accuracy results from the CCR technique and airborne lidar comparisons are within the mission requirement of 6.5 m.},

We explore a potential way of mapping this diversity by relating forest structure to tree species diversity in Gabon. First, we test the relation between canopy height, as a proxy for niche volume, and tree species diversity. Then, we test the relation between vertical canopy structure, as a proxy for vertical niche occupation, and tree species diversity. We use large footprint full-waveform airborne lidar data collected across four study sites in Gabon (Lop\'e, Mabouni\'e, Mondah, and Rabi) in combination with in situ estimates of species richness (S) and Shannon diversity (H{${'}$}). Linear models using canopy height explained 44\% and 43\% of the variation in S and H{${'}$} at the 0.25 ha resolution. Linear models using canopy height and the plant area volume density profile explained 71\% of this variation. We demonstrate applications of these models by mapping S and H{${'}$} in Mondah using a simulated GEDI-TanDEM-X fusion height product, across the four sites using wall-to-wall airborne lidar data products, and across and between the study sites using ICESat lidar waveforms. The modeling results are encouraging in the context of developing pan-tropical structure-diversity models applicable to data from current and upcoming spaceborne remote sensing missions.},

We use a broad range of data and a review of the literature to show that the effectiveness of existing, and the current pace of the establishment of new, protected areas will not be able to overcome current trends of loss of marine and terrestrial biodiversity. Despite local successes of well-designed and well-managed protected areas proving effective in stemming biodiversity loss, there are significant shortcomings in the usual process of implementation of protected areas that preclude relying on them as a global solution to this problem. The shortcomings include technical problems associated with large gaps in the coverage of critical ecological processes related to individual home ranges and propagule dispersal, and the overall failure of such areas to protect against the broad range of threats affecting ecosystems. Practical issues include budget constraints, conflicts with human development, and a growing human population that will increase not only the extent of anthropogenic stressors but the difficulty in successfully enforcing protected areas. While efforts towards improving and increasing the number and/or size of protected areas must continue, there is a clear and urgent need for the development of additional solutions for biodiversity loss, particularly ones that stabilize the size of the world's human population and our ecological demands on biodiversity.},

Protected areas had significantly lower rates of clearing in comparison to their surroundings. In addition, protected areas had also significantly lowered rates of clearing within their boundary following initiation of protection. Thus, protected areas do appear to be effective at limiting overall land-cover clearing. There was some variation in the rates of clearing across regions, where most protected areas from North America and Europe showed positive rates of land-cover change, while protected areas from Asia had the highest rates of land-cover clearing. While most protected areas from North America and Europe involved a relatively smaller number of actors, a greater number of actors and drivers of clearing was implicated in protected areas from Asia, Africa, and Latin America, indicating the increased difficulties faced by park management in these regions. In contrast, country income levels and the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources category of protection did not appear to impact the likelihood of land-cover clearing in protected areas.},

The same input datasets and sampling design are used in conjunction with four different predictive models to estimate total aboveground dry forest biomass and forest carbon. The four models include non-stratified and stratified versions of a multiple linear model where either biomass or (biomass)0.5 serves as the dependent variable. The use of different models in Qu\'ebec introduces differences in Provincial dry biomass estimates of up to 0.35 G, with a range of 4.94 {$\pm$} 0.28 Gt to 5.29 {$\pm$} 0.36 Gt. The differences among model estimates are statistically non-significant, however, and the results demonstrate the degree to which carbon estimates vary strictly as a function of the model used to estimate regional biomass. Results also indicate that GLAS measurements become problematic with respect to height and biomass retrievals in the boreal forest when biomass values fall below 20 t ha-1 and when GLAS 75th percentile heights fall below 7 m.},

Protected area managers and scientists mapped service provision hotspots, (SPHs), degraded SPHs and service benefiting areas (SBAs). In Do\~nana, SPHs were located inside the protected area and its surroundings, whereas, degraded SPHs were located primarily within the protected areas. In Sierra Nevada, most SPHs and most degraded SPHs were located inside the protected area. SBAs were located in the surrounding territory for both protected areas, especially in the neighboring cities. We also identified the major issues that faced both protected areas and their drivers of change. We found that most problems originated outside the limits of the protected areas and were produced by drivers associated with economic factors and land use changes. We discuss the implications of using ecosystem services maps for protected area management and the effects of the surrounding territory on areas within the protected zone. The results of our study demonstrate the need for a broader territorial planning strategy.},

  abstract = {Shifts in the demographic and economic character of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE) are driving patterns of land cover and land use change in the region. Such changes may have important consequences for ecosystem functioning. The objective of this paper is to quantify the trajectories and rates of change in land cover and use across the GYE for the period 1975?1995 using satellite imagery. Spectral and geographic variables were used as inputs to classification tree regression analysis (CART) to find ?rules? which defined land use and land cover classes on the landscape. The resulting CART functions were used to map land cover and land use across seven Landsat TM scenes for 1995. We then used a thresholding technique to identify locations that differed in spectral properties between the 1995 and 1985 time periods. These ?changed? locations were classified using CART functions derived from spectral and geographic data from 1985. This was similarly done for the year 1975 based on Landsat MSS data. Differences between the 1975, 1985, and 1995 maps were considered change in land cover and use. We calibrated and tested the accuracy of our models using data acquired through manual interpretation of aerial photos. Elevation and vegetative indices derived from the remotely sensed satellite imagery explained the most variance in the land use and land cover classes (i.e., defined the ?rules? most often). Overall accuracies from our study were good, ranging from 94\% at the coarsest level of detail to 74\% at the finest. The largest changes over the study period were the increases in burned, urban, and mixed conifer-herbaceous classes and decreases in woody deciduous, mixed woody deciduous?herbaceous, and conifer habitats. These changes have important implications for ecological function and biodiversity. The expansion of mixed conifer classes may increase fuel loads and enhance risk to the growing number of rural homes. The reduction of woody deciduous cover types is likely reducing population sizes for the numerous plant and animal species that specialize on this habitat type. Some of these species are also negatively influenced by the increase of rural homes in and near woody deciduous habitats. Corresponding Editor: I. C. Burke},

The Nature Conservancy and its partners have developed a ``Measures of Success'' framework with four core components: (1) identifying a limited number of focal conservation targets, (2) identifying key ecological attributes for these targets, (3) identifying an acceptable range of variation for each attribute as measured by properly selected indicators, and (4) rating target status based on whether or not the target's key attributes are within their acceptable ranges of variation. A target cannot be considered ``conserved'' if any of its key ecological attributes exceeds its acceptable range of variation. The framework provides a rigorous basis not only for measuring success but for setting conservation objectives, assessing threats to biodiversity, identifying monitoring and research needs, and communicating management information to nonspecialists.},

GEDI's primary science deliverable will be a 1 km grid of estimated mean aboveground biomass density (Mg ha-1), covering the latitudes overflown by ISS (51.6 \textdegree S to 51.6 \textdegree N). One option for using the sample of waveforms contained within an individual grid cell to produce an estimate for that cell is hybrid inference, which explicitly incorporates both sampling design and model parameter covariance into estimates of variance around the population mean. We explored statistical properties of hybrid estimators applied in the context of GEDI, using simulations calibrated with lidar and field data from six diverse sites across the United States. We found hybrid estimators of mean biomass to be unbiased and the corresponding estimators of variance appeared to be asymptotically unbiased, with under-estimation of variance by approximately 20\% when data from only two clusters (footprint tracks) were available. In our study areas, sampling error contributed more to overall estimates of variance than variability due to the model, and it was the design-based component of the variance that was the source of the variance estimator bias at small sample sizes. These results highlight the importance of maximizing GEDI's sample size in making precise biomass estimates. Given a set of assumptions discussed here, hybrid inference provides a viable framework for estimating biomass at the scale of a 1 km grid cell while formally accounting for both variability due to the model and sampling error.},

As such, forest canopy height is one of a nationwide suite of products generated by the LANDFIRE program. In the past, LANDFIRE has relied on a combination of field observations and Landsat imagery to develop existing vegetation structure products. The paucity of field data in the remote Alaskan forests has led to a very simple forest canopy height classification for the original LANDFIRE forest height map. To better meet the needs of data users and refine the map legend, LANDFIRE incorporated ICESat Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) data into the updating process when developing the LANDFIRE 2010 product. The high latitude of this region enabled dense coverage of discrete GLAS samples, from which forest height was calculated. Different methods for deriving height from the GLAS waveform data were applied, including an attempt to correct for slope. These methods were then evaluated and integrated into the final map according to predefined criteria. The resulting map of forest canopy height includes more height classes than the original map, thereby better depicting the heterogeneity of the landscape, and provides seamless data for fire behavior analysts and other users of LANDFIRE data.},

  abstract = {Spatially and temporally consistent vegetation structure time-series have great potential to improve the capacity for national land cover monitoring, to reduce latency and cost of international reporting, and to harmonize regional land cover characterizations. Here we present a semi-automatic, operational algorithm for mapping and monitoring of woody vegetation canopy cover and height at a regional scale using freely available Landsat time-series data. The presented algorithm employs automatic data processing and mapping using a set of lidar-based vegetation structure prediction models. Changes in vegetation cover are detected separately and integrated into the structure time-series. Sample-based validation and inter-comparison with existing datasets demonstrates the spatial and temporal consistency of our regional data time-series. The dataset reliably reflects changes in tree cover (tree cover loss user's accuracy of 0.84 and producer's accuracy of 0.75) and can serve as a tool to map annual forest extent (user's accuracy of 0.98 and producer's accuracy of 0.81 for 10\% canopy cover threshold to define the forest class). The tree height estimates are consistent with a GLAS-based global map (mean average error of 3.7 m, the correlation coefficient of 0.92 and the R2 of 0.85). The algorithm was prototyped within the Lower Mekong region where it revealed an intensive woody vegetation dynamic. Of the year 2000 forest area (defined using canopy cover threshold of 10\% and tree height threshold of 5 m), 9.4\% was deforested by the year 2017, and 16.6\% was affected by stand-replacement disturbance followed by reforestation. The average annual area of stand-level forest disturbance within the region was 2.34 Mha, and increased by 34\% from 2001 (1.85 Mha) to 2017 (2.48 Mha). Total forest area decreased by 6.2\% within the region, and 11.1\% of year 2000 primary forest area was lost by 2017. At the national level, Cambodia demonstrated the highest rate of deforestation, with a net forest area loss of 22.5\%. We estimated that 21.3\% of 2017 forest cover had an age of 17 years or less, illustrating the intensive forest land uses within the region. The time-series product is suitable for mapping annual land cover and inter-annual land cover change using customized class definitions. The regionally-consistent data are publicly available for download (https://glad.umd.edu/), and online analysis (https://rlcms-servir.adpc.net/en/forest-monitor/), and serve as an input to the SERVIR-Mekong Regional Land Cover Monitoring System.},

The TanDEM-X (TDX) InSAR mission of German Aerospace Center (DLR) and the upcoming Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) of National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) together may provide more accurate estimates of global forest structure and biomass via their synergic use. In this paper, we explored the efficacy of simulated GEDI data in improving height estimates from TDX InSAR data. Our study sites span three major forest types: a temperate forest, a mountainous conifer forest, and a tropical rainforest. The GEDI lidar coverage was simulated for the full nominal two-year mission duration, under both cloud-free and 50\%-cloud conditions. We then used these GEDI data to parameterize the Random Volume over Ground (RVoG) model driven by TDX imagery. In particular, we explored the following three strategies for forest structure estimation: 1) TDX data alone; 2) TDX + GEDI-derived digital terrain model (DTM); and 3) TDX + GEDI DTM + GEDI canopy height. We then validated the retrieved forest heights against wall-to-wall airborne lidar measurements. We found relatively large biases at 90 [m] spatial resolution, from 4.2\textendash 11.9 [m], and root mean square errors (RMSEs), from 7.9\textendash 12.7 [m] when using TDX data alone under constrained RVoG assumptions of a fixed extinction coefficient ({$\sigma$}) and a zero ground-to-volume amplitude ratio ({$\mu$} = 0). Results improved significantly with the aid of a DTM derived from GEDI data which enabled estimation of spatially-varying {$\sigma$} values (vs. fixed extinction) under a {$\mu$} = 0 assumption, with biases reduced to 1.7\textendash 4.2 [m] and RMSEs to 4.9\textendash 8.6 [m] across cloudy and cloud-free cases. The best agreement was achieved in the third strategy by also incorporating information of GEDI-derived canopy height to further enhance the RVoG parameters. The improved model, when still assuming {$\mu$} = 0, reduced biases to less than or close to 1 m and further reduced RMSEs to 4.0\textendash 6.7 [m]. Finally, we used GEDI data to estimate spatially-varying {$\mu$} in the RVoG model. We found biases of between -0.7\textendash 0.9 [m] and RMSEs in the range from 2.6\textendash 7.1 [m] over the three sites. Our results suggest that use of GEDI data improves height inversion from TDX, providing heights at more accuracy than can be achieved by TDX alone, and enabling wall-to-wall height estimation at much finer spatial resolution than can be achieved by GEDI alone.},

  abstract = {Physically based models provide insights into key hydrologic processes but are associated with uncertainties due to deficiencies in forcing data, model parameters, and model structure. Forcing uncertainty is enhanced in snow-affected catchments, where weather stations are scarce and prone to measurement errors, and meteorological variables exhibit high variability. Hence, there is limited understanding of how forcing error characteristics affect simulations of cold region hydrology and which error characteristics are most important. Here we employ global sensitivity analysis to explore how (1) different error types (i.e., bias, random errors), (2) different error probability distributions, and (3) different error magnitudes influence physically based simulations of four snow variables (snow water equivalent, ablation rates, snow disappearance, and sublimation). We use the Sobol' global sensitivity analysis, which is typically used for model parameters but adapted here for testing model sensitivity to coexisting errors in all forcings. We quantify the Utah Energy Balance model's sensitivity to forcing errors with 1 840 000 Monte Carlo simulations across four sites and five different scenarios. Model outputs were (1) consistently more sensitive to forcing biases than random errors, (2) generally less sensitive to forcing error distributions, and (3) critically sensitive to different forcings depending on the relative magnitude of errors. For typical error magnitudes found in areas with drifting snow, precipitation bias was the most important factor for snow water equivalent, ablation rates, and snow disappearance timing, but other forcings had a more dominant impact when precipitation uncertainty was due solely to gauge undercatch. Additionally, the relative importance of forcing errors depended on the model output of interest. Sensitivity analysis can reveal which forcing error characteristics matter most for hydrologic modeling.},

  abstract = {Plant biodiversity supports life on Earth and provides a range of important ecosystem services, but is under severe pressure by global change. Structural diversity plays a crucial role for carbon, water and energy cycles and animal habitats. However, it is very difficult to map and monitor over large areas, limiting our ability to assess the status of biodiversity and predict change. NASA's Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) provides a new opportunity to measure 3D plant canopy structure of the world's temperate, Mediterranean and tropical ecosystems, but its potential to map structural diversity is not yet tested. Here, we use wall-to-wall airborne laser scanning (ALS) to simulate GEDI data (GEDIsim) over 7380 km2 in the southern Sierra Nevada mountains in California and evaluate how well GEDI's sampling scheme captures patterns of structural diversity. We evaluate functional richness and functional beta diversity in a biodiversity hot spot. GEDIsim performed well for trait retrievals (r2 = 0.68) and functional richness mapping (r2 = 0.75) compared to ALS retrievals, despite lower correlations in complex terrain with steep slopes. Functional richness patterns were strongly associated with soil organic carbon stocks and density as well as variables related to water availability and could be appropriately mapped by GEDIsim with and without cloud cover. Functional beta diversity was more strongly related to local changes in topography and more challenging to map, especially with decreasing sampling density. The reduced number of GEDIsim shots when simulating cloud cover lead to a strong overestimation of beta diversity and a reduction of r2 from 0.64 to 0.40 compared to ALS. The ability to map functional richness has been demonstrated with potential application at continental scales that could be transformative for our understanding of large-scale patterns of plant canopy structure, diversity and potential links to animal diversity, movement and habitats.},

The simulator is initialized by airborne lidar measurements performed over temperate and tropical forests on the French territory, representing a wide range of forests ecosystems. Considering two complementary wavelengths of 355 and 1064 nm, the end-to-end simulator computes the performance of spaceborne lidar systems for different orbits. The analysis is based on forest structural (tree top height, quadratic mean canopy height) and optical (forest optical thickness) parameters. Although an ultraviolet lidar appears to be a good candidate for airborne measurements, our results show that the limited energy is not favorable for spaceborne missions with such a wavelength. A near infrared wavelength at 1064 nm is preferable, requiring \textasciitilde 100 mJ laser emitted energy, which is in agreement with current and future spaceborne missions involving a lidar. We find that the signal-to-noise ratio at the ground level to extract both the structural and optical parameters of forests must be larger than 10. Hence, considering the presence of clouds and aerosols in the atmosphere and assuming a stationary forest, a good detection probability of 99\% can be reached when 4 or 5 satellite revisits are considered for a lidar system onboard the ISS or ICESat, respectively. This concerns \textasciitilde 90\% of forest covers observed from the lidar, which have an optical thickness less than 3.},

NASA's current GEDI and ICESat-2 missions as well as the upcoming NISAR mission will collect synergistic data with different coverage and sensitivity to AGB. In this study, we present a multi-sensor data fusion approach leveraging the strength of each mission to produce wall-to-wall AGB maps that are more accurate and spatially comprehensive than what is achievable with any one sensor alone. Specifically, we calibrate a regional L-band radar AGB model using the sparse, simulated spaceborne lidar AGB estimates. We assess our data fusion framework using simulations of GEDI, ICESat-2 and NISAR data from airborne laser scanning (ALS) and UAVSAR data acquired over the temperate high AGB forest and complex terrain in Sonoma County, California, USA. For ICESat-2 and GEDI missions, we simulate two years of data coverage and AGB at footprint level are estimated using realistic AGB models. We compare the performance of our fusion framework when different combinations of the sparse simulated GEDI and ICEsat-2 AGB estimates are used to calibrate our regional L-band AGB models. In addition, we test our framework at Sonoma using (a) 1-ha square grid cells and (b) similarly sized irregularly shaped objects. We demonstrate that the estimated mean AGB across Sonoma is more accurately estimated using our fusion framework than using GEDI or ICESat-2 mission data alone, either with a regular grid or with irregular segments as mapping units. This research highlights methodological opportunities for fusing new and upcoming active remote sensing data streams toward improved AGB mapping through data fusion.},

  abstract = {Detailed characterization of global forest dynamics requires accurate measurements of canopy cover beyond estimating the extent of forested area. Passive-optical remote sensing techniques, despite remarkable success in identifying global hotspots of forest cover loss, cannot fully satisfy observation requirements at the plot or canopy crown level. Critical issues including signal saturation and algorithm uncertainty impose limitations on capturing subtle canopy cover changes using standard products generated from satellite imagery, particularly over largely intact dense tropical forests. Spaceborne lidar remote sensing can fill this gap in contemporary Earth observation networks by providing direct measurements of 3-D canopy structure. Here we analyze global canopy cover distributions using observations from the Geoscience Laser Altimetry System (GLAS) onboard of NASA's Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat-1). We found ICESat-based cover estimates were sensitive to canopy cover dynamics even over dense forests with cover exceeding 80\% and were able to better characterize biome-level gradients and canopy cover distributions than the existing products derived from conventional optical remote sensing. At the footprint level, ICESat-1 produced almost no bias when compared with airborne estimates, and had RMSE values on the order of \textasciitilde 20\% cover. Improved cover products based on lidar should allow comprehensive analysis of subtle forest structure changes at landscape scales, and provide unique information for biophysical stratification of forests and changes in vertical canopy structure. This is particularly true given the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) lidar recently installed on the International Space Station, which will acquire higher resolution lidar data at greater sampling densities than has been available to date.},

  abstract = {Tropical forests provide global climate regulation ecosystem services and their clearing is a significant source of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and resultant radiative forcing of climate change. However, consensus on pan-tropical forest carbon dynamics is lacking. We present a new estimate that employs recommended good practices to quantify gross tropical forest aboveground carbon (AGC) loss from 2000 to 2012 through the integration of Landsat-derived tree canopy cover, height, intactness and forest cover loss and GLAS-lidar derived forest biomass. An unbiased estimate of forest loss area is produced using a stratified random sample with strata derived from a wall-to-wall 30 m forest cover loss map. Our sample-based results separate the gross loss of forest AGC into losses from natural forests (0.59 PgC yr-1) and losses from managed forests (0.43 PgC yr-1) including plantations, agroforestry systems and subsistence agriculture. Latin America accounts for 43\% of gross AGC loss and 54\% of natural forest AGC loss, with Brazil experiencing the highest AGC loss for both categories at national scales. We estimate gross tropical forest AGC loss and natural forest loss to account for 11\% and 6\% of global year 2012 CO2 emissions, respectively. Given recent trends, natural forests will likely constitute an increasingly smaller proportion of tropical forest GHG emissions and of global emissions as fossil fuel consumption increases, with implications for the valuation of co-benefits in tropical forest conservation.},

  abstract = {Forest represents a challenging problem for snow-cover mapping by optical satellite remote sensing. To investigate reflectance variability and to improve the mapping of snow in forested areas, a method for subpixel mapping of snow cover in forests (SnowFrac) has been developed. The SnowFrac method is based on linear spectral mixing modelling of snow, trees and snow-free ground. The focus has been on developing a physically based reflectance model which uses a forest-cover map as prior information. The method was tested in flat terrain covered by spruce, pine and birch forests, close to the Jotunheimen region of South Norway. Experiments were carried out using a completely snow-covered Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) scene, aerial photos and in situ reflectance measurements. A detailed forest model was photogrammetrically derived from the aerial photos. Modelled and observed TM reflectances were compared. In the given situation, the results demonstrate that snow and individual tree species, in addition to cast shadows on the snow surface from single trees, are the most influencing factors on visible and near-infrared reflectance. Modelling of diffuse radiation reduced by surrounding trees slightly improve the results, indicating that this effect is less important. The best results are obtained for pine forest and mixed pine and birch forest. Future work will focus on deriving a simplified reflectance model suitable for operational snow-cover mapping in forests.},

  abstract = {The ability to use digital remotely sensed data for forest inventory is often limited by the nature of the measures, which, with the exception of multi-angular or stereo observations, are largely insensitive to vertically distributed attributes. As a result, empirical estimates are typically made to characterize attributes such as height, volume, or biomass, with known asymptotic relationships as signal saturation occurs. Lidar (light detection and ranging) has emerged as a robust means to collect and subsequently characterize vertically distributed attributes. Lidar has been established as an appropriate data source for forest inventory purposes; however, large area monitoring and mapping activities with lidar remain challenging due to the logistics, costs, and data volumes involved. The use of lidar as a sampling tool for large-area estimation may mitigate some or all of these problems. A number of factors drive, and are common to, the use of airborne profiling, airborne scanning, and spaceborne lidar systems as sampling tools for measuring and monitoring forest resources across areas that range in size from tens of thousands to millions of square kilometers. In this communication, we present the case for lidar sampling as a means to enable timely and robust large-area characterizations. We briefly outline the nature of different lidar systems and data, followed by the theoretical and statistical underpinnings for lidar sampling. Current applications are presented and the future potential of using lidar in an integrated sampling framework for large area ecosystem characterization and monitoring is presented. We also include recommendations regarding statistics, lidar sampling schemes, applications (including data integration and stratification), and subsequent information generation.},
